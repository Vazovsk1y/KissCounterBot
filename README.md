# KissCounterBot 
## Telegram bot for interaction between users in group.   
The main idea of the bot is to create a system of rewards in the form of "kisses".  
When a user likes a message of another user, instead of the usual likes on the  message he can use the command 
/kiss like reply on message that he likes, thus kissing that user.  Also, these kisses are saved and any user 
in the group at any time can request the top of all users  with their value of kisses in a particular group.  

Below is the syntax for using commands.
